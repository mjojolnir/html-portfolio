<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a first-year student at BINA Nusantara University, pursuing a degree in
  Computer Science. Passionate about technology and always eager to learn, I am
  actively exploring various technology fields.
</p>

<p>
  I have various skills like time management, self - discipline, adaptability,
  teamwork, and many more else. I participated actively in my school's student
  council as the head of Bidang Kerohanian. I also volunteered once as an MPLS
  Mentor to new freshmens at my Senior High School.

  Also, I enjoy hitting the weights and just socializing with people. Well, I
  wasn't really this extroverted as I was in my school, but things changed and I
  had to improvize so I don't get held back by society. That's all. Thank you!
